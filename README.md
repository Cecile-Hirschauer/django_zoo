## Bugs / UX errors to fix

* The application crashes when we try to get the age of an animal that has a NULL date of birth

* There’s no feedback when a user successfully moves an animal from one enclosure to another. 

* There are several places in the application where plurals are not respected. 

* Add a name to enclosures (display if exists)

* change the display values of the select field to move an animal, in order to have something more readable (name of the enclosure + the number of spots left in it)

## New functionalities to add

* Filter animals by diet type too, not only by gender

* Add validation to make sure that ‘Carnivore’ type animals cannot be moved to an enclosure that contains anything other than ‘Carnivore’ animals

* Add for users the ability to reset and change their password

* Add any animal to a list of favorite animals and to have a “Favorites” page where they can see all their favorite animals. The ‘Favorites’ page should not be accessible to users who are not logged in
